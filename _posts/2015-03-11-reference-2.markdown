    <p>I met Mr C on the first night of my trip to Cambodia. From day one he was polite, friendly and extremely helpful.
    Mr C went out of his way to try and help me and my friends with transport on weekends and to our placements during
    our 6 week stay. Being in a new country with very big language barriers it can be frustrating trying to find reliable
    and trustworthy people, however having Mr C as a driver was amazing. I never felt unsafe, he would remind us
    constantly to keep ourselves safe and watch our belongings when travelling by tuc tuc and was always willing to
    give advice. Multiple evenings he would take us and pick us up from different locations as we'll as coming to my
    rescue one evening after having a few drinks and getting locked out of my accommodation accidentally. Mr C stayed
    with me for half an hour at 3am and helped me work out a way to find my friend and get me to a safe place to sleep.
    Being a 19 year old girl, alone in the middle of a Cambodian street after midnight Is not a situation you want to
    put yourself in. The whole time I was with Mr C I never felt unsafe and was extremely appreciative of how he helped
    me especially because I had no cash on me and he was happy to wait until the morning for me to pay him back. Mr C
    is one of the most genuine people I have ever come across. He takes a lot of pride in his work and delivers a great
    service. If you are needing transport in Phnom Penh and for weekend trips to other provinces, I would 100%
    recommend Mr C. Enjoy your travels!
