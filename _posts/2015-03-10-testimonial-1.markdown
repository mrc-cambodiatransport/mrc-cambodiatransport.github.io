    <p>Ingrid got to know Mr. C when she was working as a volunteer in Phnom Penh in 2014 for 2 months. Mr. C and his
    brother in law, Chan, drove her around town and on daytrips during her whole stay, and they became good friends.
    This year (2015) Ingrid came back with her husband for a 3 week holiday in Cambodia. We used Mr. C as our
    "private driver" for many trips in and around Phnom Pehn, and a longer 3 day trip to Sen Monorom where we visited
    the Elephant Valley Project.</p>
    <p>Mr. C is an excellent driver and an all around nice guy with a warm heart. He speaks English very well, and we always
    enjoy his company. We give Mr. C our very best recommendation and will for sure use his services again on our next
    visit!</p>
