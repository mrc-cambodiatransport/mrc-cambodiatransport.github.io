    This would have to be the best transport service in Cambodia! Not only safe and reliable, Mr C will go above and
    beyond to make your stay in Cambodia memorable. His local knowledge and his grasp on the English language is
    invaluable!
    His honesty is unquestionable! If you get the opportunity to travel to Kep with Mr C's transport services, your
    in for a treat. The best fresh crab I have tasted anywhere in the world!! Mr C arranged the purchase and the
    choice of seafood from the locals in Kep, ensuring I got not only the best available, but he made sure I was not
    over charged. It's these little things that make all the difference!!
    Safe. Reliable. Friendly. Funny. Safe. Genuine. Affordable. Quality. And a great bloke!!!
    I write this testimonial with no hesitation, to recommend Mr C for your transport services whilst in Cambodia.
